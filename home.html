<p>DigiByte is a decentralized blockchain with a public ledger type, as well as the name of the native cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>What makes DigiByte truly decentralized&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the Bitcoin code base, the DigiByte Blockchain was created in 2013 and was officially launched to the public in January 10, 2014.</p>
<p>The code is open-sourced and released under MIT license, development is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Although both solid projects, DigiByte sets out to compliment what is considered as shortcomings with its predecessors, Bitcoin and Litecoin, with increased block speed, real-time difficulty adjustment and increased security. With a 1000:1 ratio compared to Bitcoin, the idea is that less devising of a full coin will result in less complications in terms of transactions for the end-user, meaning that overseeing and performing a transaction becomes less cumbersome and make for a more wholehearted user experience. This also means that it is more viable for a user to own at least one full DigiByte, rather than just fractions of one.</p>
<p>Because of these adjustments in the code, DigiByte is perfectly suitable for facilitating fast, secure and immutable transactions, containing both monetary value as well as other communication data.<br><br><strong><u>TO BE CONTINUED</u></strong></p>
