# Description

DigiByte is a decentralized blockchain with a public ledger type, as well as the name of the native cryptocurrency.

What makes DigiByte truly decentralizedÂ 

Based on the Bitcoin code base, the DigiByte Blockchain was created in 2013 and was officially launched to the public in January 10, 2014.

The code is open-sourced and released under MIT license, development is still ongoing.

Although both solid projects, DigiByte sets out to compliment what is considered as shortcomings with its predecessors, Bitcoin and Litecoin, with increased block speed, real-time difficulty adjustment and increased security. With a 1000:1 ratio compared to Bitcoin, the idea is that less devising of a full coin will result in less complications in terms of transactions for the end-user, meaning that overseeing and performing a transaction becomes less cumbersome and make for a more wholehearted user experience. This also means that it is more viable for a user to own at least one full DigiByte, rather than just fractions of one.

Because of these adjustments in the code, DigiByte is perfectly suitable for facilitating fast, secure and immutable transactions, containing both monetary value as well as other communication data.
